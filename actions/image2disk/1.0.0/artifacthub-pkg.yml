description: This action will stream a remote disk image (raw) to a block device, and is mainly used to write cloud images to a disk. It is recommended to use the `qemu-img` tool to convert disk images into raw, it is also possible to compress the raw images with tar+gzip to prevent wasted disk space

    The below example will stream a raw ubuntu cloud image (converted by qemu-img) and write it to the block storage disk `/dev/sda`. The raw image is uncompressed in this example.

    ```
    actions:
        - name: "stream ubuntu"
          image: quay.io/tinkerbell-actions/image2disk:v1.0.0
          timeout: 90
          environment:
              IMG_URL: 192.168.1.2/ubuntu.raw
              DEST_DISK: /dev/sda
              COMPRESSED: false
    ```

    The below example will stream a compressed raw ubuntu cloud image (converted by qemu-img) and then compressed with tar/gzip to reduce local space.

    ```
    qemu-img convert ubuntu.img ubuntu.raw
    tar -cvzf ubuntu.tar.gz ubuntu.raw
    ```

    ```
    actions:
        - name: "stream ubuntu"
          image: quay.io/tinkerbell-actions/image2disk:v1.0.0
          timeout: 90
          environment:
              IMG_URL: 192.168.1.2/ubuntu.tar.gz
              DEST_DISK: /dev/sda
              COMPRESSED: true
    ```
