    The below example will use the same action in three ways, to "partition" followed by "formating" and finally mounting the disks. All of the different commands below `partition`/`format`/`mount`, will have their actions determined by the contents of the storage section in the metadata refer to the[Customer Partitioning and RAID](https://deploy.equinix.com/developers/docs/metal/storage/custom-partitioning-raid/) documentation for more information.

    ```
    actions:
      - name: "disk-wipe-partition"
        image: quay.io/tinkerbell-actions/rootio:v1.0.0
        timeout: 90
        command: ["partition"]
        environment:
          MIRROR_HOST: 192.168.1.2
      - name: "format"
        image: quay.io/tinkerbell-actions/rootio:v1.0.0
        timeout: 90
        command: ["format"]
        environment:
          MIRROR_HOST: 192.168.1.2
      - name: "mount"
        image: quay.io/tinkerbell-actions/rootio:v1.0.0
        timeout: 90
        command: ["mount"]
        environment:
          MIRROR_HOST: 192.168.1.2
    ```

    **Advanced**

    For certain use-cases we may need to use [MBR]() support, examples being VMware vSphere and it's installer. In order to support this, we can pass an environment variable to rootio for `partition` options.

    ```
    actions:
      - name: "disk-wipe-partition"
        image: quay.io/tinkerbell-actions/rootio:v1.0.0
        timeout: 90
        command: ["partition"]
        environment:
          MIRROR_HOST: 192.168.1.2
          MBR: true
    ```

    This also supports an extended version of CPR:

    ```
    "storage": {
        "disks": [
          {
            "device": "/dev/sdb",
            "partitions": [
              {
                "label": "FAT32_ACTIVE",
                "number": 1,
                "size": 0
              }
            ],
            "wipe_table": true
          }
        ],
        "filesystems": [
          {
            "mount": {
              "create": {
                "options": ["-L", "ROOT"]
              },
              "device": "/dev/sdb1",
              "format": "vfat",
              "point": "/"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ```

    Where labels `FAT32/Linux` can be appended with `_ACTIVE` to make them a bootable partition.
